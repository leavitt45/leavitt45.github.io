<p> <a Name=Parents> My parents have always worked hard so that I could have everything I needed my dad was a marine like my grandfather and my mother was an MIS major. They took different routes after highschool but still found eachother and have been happily married for 20 years. My dad enjoys snowmobiles and the patriots while my mom enjoys gardening and the Red Sox </a>
