<p> <a Name=Dogs> I have always had one dog growing up his name was Sam and we got him when I was 5 and He just recently passed away. 
	Ella and brady are my two new chocolate labs, Ella is 5 and was sams protege. Brady is 13 weeks and we got him for my moms 
	birthday. They are both spoiled rotten and their favorite meal is Mac and cheese.
